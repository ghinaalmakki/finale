        <h2>Some background stuff.</h2>
        <p>I began drawing in October of 2021. At the time, I wasn't extremely interested in art as a hobby, 
            but I had several friends who were, and already some creative interest in other subjects, 
            such as writing, or story telling. I've consistently been practicing art since then, with encouragement from friends who were previously into art,
            and now I do it frequently! Digital art is one of the mediums I do particularly, working on both Procreate on the iPad and my laptop.</p>
        <h2>Interests!</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Video Games</li>
                <ol>
                    <li>Visual novels. particularly Ace Attorney at the moment.</li>
                    <li>PLATFORMERS!!! A Hat In Time, Mario and Kirby games, Here Comes Niko, etc.</li>
                    <li>Dressup games are fun. I like designing characters so it's good for art inspo. SuitU and Love Nikki are examples.</li>
                    <li>Open world games like BOTW, Legends Arceus, Infinity Nikki come to mind. I love having flexibility within a game.</li>
                </ol>
            <li>Graphic Novels</li>
                <ol>
                    <li>Once again, for art reasons-it's inspiring.</li>
                    <li>Reading is fun. Also, attention span stuff is easier with visuals.</li>
                    <li>I think reading about different people and perspectives lets people be more open minded.</li>
                </ol>
            <li>Cartoons</li>
            <ol>

                <li>It's nice to have on while doing other tasks.</li>
                <li>Cartoons will always be special to me.</li>
